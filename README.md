# FIGHT
## Fancy Isometric Gerrymandering Hasty Toss Up.
### Goal:
  What we want to do with this plugin is create classes that basically have superpowers. There will be a large variety if choices in classes, but they will mainly be either magic or nonmagic. Nonmagic classes will still have abilities that use mana/stanima, but they won't be "spells", just abilities. Magic classes will have spells.
  
  The xp bar will be you stanima/mana bar, and it will fill up constantly through the game. Based on your abiltiy, using it will use up some of your mana/stanima. If you dont have enough to use the spell/abiltiy, it won't activate.
  
  There are 3 kinds of abilities/spells: Targetted, Untargetted, and Passive. Targetted abilities/spells will only activate when you click on another player, and the effect usually revolves around the other player. Untargetted abilities/spells will have an effect no matter what you click on, but it usually effects only you or your surroundings. A spell/ability may have targetted and untargetted effects, and will activate according to whether your crosshairs are on a Player or something else. Passive abilities/spells can be toggled on/off by clicking. These abilites are passive, as the name suggests, and will turn off when they run out of fuel (stanima/mana).
  
  These classes should allow for some good FIGHTing, and you can work to specialize in any of the classes. We are planning on making a lot of classes, and we will do our best to make them good and unique. Its hard because Spigot/Bukkit dont do a lot of stuff that mods can do, but they can do a lot of things anyway!
