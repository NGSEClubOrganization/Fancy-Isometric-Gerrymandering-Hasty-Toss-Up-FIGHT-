If it does, that specific ability is activated.&\#x0A;THE LORE IS THE PART OF THE ITEM THAT IS CHECKED. I tried to find a way&\#x0A;to attach the &lt;Ability&gt; directly, but ItemMeta only holds Strings in the&\#x0A;form of Display Name and Lore, so I used lore for the operational part.</message>\n<message>Added attack, ability, and spell</message>\n<message>Help command</message>\n</messages>
